An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined.

Syntax:
(function () {
    statements
})();

It is a design pattern which is also known as a Self-Executing Anonymous Function and contains two major parts. 
1.The first is the anonymous function with lexical scope enclosed within the Grouping Operator (). This prevents accessing
variables within the IIFE idiom as well as polluting the global scope.
2.The second part creates the immediately executing function expression ()through which the JavaScript engine will directly 
interpret the function.
NOTE:
All the programs in node js are by default works as a IIFE function.
The entrie program is wrapped inside a IIFE function
function(__dirname,__filename,exports,..)
{
//node js code
})();
