Call:
The call() method is used to write a method that can be used on different objects.
It can be used to invoke (call) a method with an owner object as an argument (parameter).
this Keyword:
In a function definition, this refers to the "owner" of the function.

bind:
The bind() method creates a new function that, when called, has its this keyword set to the 
provided value, with a given sequence of arguments preceding any provided when the new function is called.

apply:
With the apply() method, you can write a method that can be used on different objects.
The apply() method accepts arguments in an array


The difference is:
The call() method takes arguments separately.
The apply() method takes arguments as an array.
The apply() method is very handy if you want to use an array instead of an argument list.
