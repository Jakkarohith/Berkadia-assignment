EventEmitter Class:

// Import events module
var events = require('events');

// Create an eventEmitter object
var eventEmitter = new events.EventEmitter();

When an EventEmitter instance faces any error, it emits an 'error' event. When a new listener is added,
'newListener' event is fired and when a listener is removed, 'removeListener' event is fired.
EventEmitter provides multiple properties like on and emit. on property is used to bind a
function with the event and emit is used to fire an event.
