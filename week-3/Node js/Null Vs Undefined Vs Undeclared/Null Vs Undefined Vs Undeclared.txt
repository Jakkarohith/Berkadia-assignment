Null:
Null is a keyword in JavaScript that signifies ‘no value’ or nonexistence of any value. 
If you wish to shred a variable off its assigned value, you can simply assign ‘null’ to it. 
Besides this, like any other object, it is never implicitly assigned to a variable by JavaScript.

Undefined:
‘Undefined’ is a global variable that JavaScript creates at run time. This global variable is assigned
 to an object in one of the following cases Declared but not defined, Array index or object property that does not exist. etc

Undeclared:
The use  of'console.log();' and 'type of' to check if a variable is undefined or null. undeclared 
variables is a variable that has been declared without 'var' keyword. var testVar = 'hello world';
When former code is executed, undeclared variables are created as global variable and they are configurable
